# 📚 Smart Learning Assistant

**An AI-powered tool designed to support self-directed learning through document-based Q&A and personalized learning path planning.**

## 🔍 Overview

Smart Learning Assistant is an AI solution designed to empower learners in navigating complex topics independently. This tool combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with an agentic multi-agent architecture to deliver two core functionalities:

1. **RAG Bot**: Enables accurate document-based question answering using hybrid search on uploaded PDFs, DOCX files, and external URLs.
2. **Agentic System**: Uses intelligent agents to discover online resources, plan learning paths, and provide step-by-step study roadmaps based on user's topic.


## ✨ Key Features
- **🔍 Hybrid RAG Retrieval**: 
	- Multi-format document support, such as PDFs, DOCX files, and web links.
	- Combines semantic and keyword-based (keyword + vector)  search to enhance answer accuracy.
- **🤖 Multi-Agent System**: Intelligent agents collaborate to:
  - Search for relevant topics and resources.
  - Build personalized study plans.
- **🖥️ User Interface**: Interactive Streamlit frontend for ease of use and real-time interaction.
